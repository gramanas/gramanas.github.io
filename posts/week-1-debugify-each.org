A first iteration of [[https://reviews.llvm.org/D46525][Debugify-each]] has landed earlier this week. The tool works as expected
but it's a bit rough around the edges.

For starters debugify only prints if a pass passed or failed, and not the pass name.
That was not a problem before debugify-each because you knew in what pass you would
run debugify. Now running debugify-each will fill the output with PASS or FAIL
without any information about the name of the pass.
I authored a [[https://reviews.llvm.org/D46908][patch]] to fix that.

Another problem is that when running debugify-each in one of the standard pipelines (~-O{1-3}~) it will
fill the terminal with it's output -- both errors and whether the pass failed or passed
the check-debugify.

This is not the correct way a tool like debugify should work. A user should be able to 
pipe opt's output to other tools while also using debugify-each. To remedy this
another [[https://reviews.llvm.org/D46941][patch]] redirects the warnings and errors to =stderr= and as a follow-up
debugify should dump it's results to a file.
