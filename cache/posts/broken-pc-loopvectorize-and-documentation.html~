It has been quite some time since I last posted. 
My computer has reached EOL and I am in the process
of getting a new one up and running.
</p>

<p>
The past weeks, I've been working through a VPS
graciously provided to me by my university, but sadly it has
many cons. For starters it could only run CentOS 6 or 7.
I went with the latter but it hardly made any difference
in terms of the packages being too old for a proper llvm
development experience.
</p>

<p>
So, I had to compile a lot of the software like cmake
in order to get it working with the current llvm dev setup.
I also had to compile a recent version of emacs
( &gt;= 25.1 ) in order to be able to run the required stuff
I use to navigate the code base.
</p>

<p>
When I had finally compiled clang I realized the I couldn't debug
it with a 10 year old gdb. While looking for answers online
<code>scl</code> was my Deus Ex Machina. It's a redhat tool and a shortcut for
Software CoLlections. It came with an extra repo for yum, though it, 
I could download precompiled versions of the gnu dev toolset 7
(gcc, gdb, etc.) and have them alongside the centOS 7 defaults. 
It works a bit like a virtualenv does for python,
issuing a command that changes environment variables to point
to the newer software installed under <code>/opt</code>. So far it works
perfectly so I didn't bother looking more into it, 
since it's just a means to an end.
</p>

<p>
It's not the best experience but it will be more than enough
until my new PC is set up. Connecting to it requires me to first
connect to the university VPN which makes browsing a bit slow, and
since the VPS service is pretty much at it's infancy things tend to
not work properly sometimes. Thankfully I didn't have any major 
setbacks due to this.

These past weeks since my last post, beside the afformentioned,
I worked on some DI related bugs in the LoopVectorize pass.
</p>

<p>
It's a fairly complicated pass that, due to it's nature, 
currently produces quite a lot of debugify errors. Also there are some
fairly old (2013) and confusing functions that handle DebugLoc,
but don't seem to do so using the establised API and are also
members of the LoopVectorize family of classes (while they would
fit more in a shared Utility class).

These patches are <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48769">D48769</a>, <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48968">D48968</a> and <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D49347">D49347</a>. The last one is WIP
and also highlighs one of the confusing functions I mentioned.

<h2 id="orgcadf0b5">Documentation update</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcadf0b5">
<p>
Even projects with a tiny amount of contributors can benefit hugely
from good documentation. These benefits are multiplied when huge
projects like llvm implement this. A very good example is the 
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html">LLVM Language Reference Manual</a> as well as the
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html">Getting Started with the LLVM System</a> page which both helped me
immensly while trying to learn my way around llvm (they are both
bookmars on my firefox toolbar atm!)
</p>

<p>
To that end I wrote some <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html#testing-debug-info-preservation-in-optimizations">documentation</a> about debugify and how to use it
to find and test for DI related bugs. Helping with streamlining the
testing of such errors and hoping that future pass developers will
have these in mind when desinging the transformations.
