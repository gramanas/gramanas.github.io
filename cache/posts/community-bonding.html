My proposal was accepted!

For the next few days it's the community bonding period. I will take advantage
of this time to let the community know about my project and it's goals, as well
as get a head start on the coding period.

The first step to improving the debugging of optimized code is to measure
where we lose Debug information.
Verdant has already created the tool to do that. It's the <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D40512">debugify mode</a>.
Currently <code>debugify</code> is a <code>ModulePass</code> and works like <a href="https://gramanas.github.io/posts/finding-debuginfo-loss/">that</a>. 
It needs to be refactored into a <code>FunctionPass</code> while keeping the
same underying logic. That way it will be managed from the <code>FunctionPassManager</code>.
</p>

<p>
Next the opt tool should have a custom <code>PassManager</code> that injects the new
debugify before a pass and then the new check-debugify after it. This will
be a new mode called debugify-each. It will basically gather DI loss from
every pass in the pipeline.
</p>

<p>
<code>Debugify</code> as <code>ModulePass</code> will still be avaliable but it will be a wrapper
around the <code>FunctionPass</code> one.

The resulting DI loss occurences will be stored into some kinde of human readable
data serialization format, like JSON or YAML.

More on that on a later post.
