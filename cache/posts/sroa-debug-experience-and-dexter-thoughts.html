<p>
The past weeks the efforts were focused around the Scalar Replacement of
Aggregates pass. This is an early stage pass and thus the amount of debug
info loss should be minimized cause it impacts the whole compiler a lot more.
</p>

<p>
Our contribution has been to systematically show that IR-level 
invariants on debug info are being respected by SROA/mem2reg.
</p>

<p>
The debugify pass with the newly implemented <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D46525">debugify-each</a> option was the
main tool used.

<p>
I made a <a href="https://gramanas.github.io/posts/sroa-on-amalgamated-sqlite-source/">report</a> after ruining SROA on the amalgamated sqlite source.
The results were a clear indication that SROA was doing it's job just fine
and the little instructions without DebugLoc were produced from clang and it
wasn't SROA/mem2reg's fault.
</p>

<p>
After applying the above clang patches the results are even better.

<h2 id="orgfbe68f2">Comparing the results to <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2018-04/slides/Bedwell-Measuring_the_User_Debugging_Experience.pdf">dexter</a> ones</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfbe68f2">
<p>
Dexter scored SROA low.
</p>

<p>
As Greg (dexter's creator) mentions the dexter results don't have
to indicate that there is some kind of bug
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My standard disclaimer with all results from this tool is that a
non-perfect debugging experience score is not necessarily indicative of
something wrong, but should be looked at in conjunction with all the other
factors such as what the pass is trying to achieve optimization-wise.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And such is the case with SROA.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37682">bug report</a> has been filed explaining the problem.
</p>

<p>
Basically after running SROA/mem2reg the optimizations will
at many cases result in weird stepping behavior in the debugger.
This is normal since that's the whole point of passes like SROA and
LICM: to reduce the instructions by optimizing aggregates and loops.
</p>

<p>
This is bad from the debug perspective and thus scores low on dexter.

<h3 id="orgae29aae">Optimized vs unoptimized debugging</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgae29aae">
<p>
An optimizers job is to make the code execute faster on the given 
machine. This comes at the cost of modifying the code to a point
that it no longer resembles the source material. Thus we rely on
the descriptive power of the standard that is used to encode DI.
</p>

<p>
Passes that move code around or shorten the execution paths like
SROA and LICM should go to great lengths to preserve the debug 
intrinsics that correspond the the name and value of the variables.
It would be an unrealistic goal to try and keep the stepping behavior
inside a debugger intact after running such passes. 
</p>

<p>
Instead different optimization methods can be used when debugging
is a high priority. Ones that don't move code around as much and of course
result in longer execution times, but what they lose in speed they give
back with a more robust debug experience.

<h2 id="org1f4f0a5">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1f4f0a5">
<p>
SROA does a very good job preserving all the important Debug Information
that it's given. On the other hand it significantly impacts the debug
user experience but there is nothing that can be done about it as this is 
the nature of the transformation.
