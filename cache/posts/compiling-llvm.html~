After looking through the 2018 GSoC projects LLVM
stands out as the most interesting one for me.
</p>

<p>
Not before it's even time to contact anyone from the
project, I should at least build it first and verify that it passes
any tests it might have.
</p>

<p>
Being the inexperianced pleb that I am, for two days I couldn't even
build it without my PC running out of RAM in the middle of the build.
</p>

<p>
"I should get more RAM" - I thought.
</p>

<p>
Yeah right.
