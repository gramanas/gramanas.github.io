<p>
A first iteration of <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D46525">Debugify-each</a> has landed earlier this week. The tool works as expected
but it's a bit rough around the edges.
</p>

<p>
For starters debugify only prints if a pass passed or failed, and not the pass name.
That was not a problem before debugify-each because you knew in what pass you would
run debugify. Now running debugify-each will fill the output with PASS or FAIL
without any information about the name of the pass.
I authored a <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D46908">patch</a> to fix that.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that when running debugify-each in one of the standard pipelines (<code>-O{1-3}</code>) it will
fill the terminal with it's output &#x2013; both errors and whether the pass failed or passed
the check-debugify.
</p>

<p>
This is not the correct way a tool like debugify should work. A user should be able to 
pipe opt's output to other tools while also using debugify-each. To remedy this
another <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D46941">patch</a> redirects the warnings and errors to <code>stderr</code> and as a follow-up
debugify should dump it's results to a file.
